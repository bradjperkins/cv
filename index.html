    <p><em>Developer & Innovation Strategy Consultant, Founder of <strong><a href="http://redseamcreative.com/">RedSeam Creative</a></strong></em></p>
    <p>Characterized as a person that is futuristic, strategic, artistic, and a visionary, I have taken my strengths of creative problem solving and used them in several different venues. By observing problems and inefficiencies both in business and in
      society, I have a knack for creating solutions. Through this ability I have started businesses and created products for myself and other businesses. I have picked up skills in sales, marketing, analytics, administration, and customer service.
      These skills have taught me to adapt to given situations and objectives. My ability for understanding and adapting allows me to be a quick learner in whatever I do. </p>
